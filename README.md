<h2>What I Learned From This Project:</h2>
<p>This project took me quite some time to get to a place where I was happy with a working product.
<p>I think my biggest problem from the start was focusing too much on the look and layout before I had a working application. I spent hours twiddling with the CSS before I had the logic nailed down. Additionally, I went into this without much of an overall plan. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do and what needed to happen, but I should have had much more detail and logic planned out before I got so deep into the code.</p>
<p>I started out using a class workflow but ended up getting confused and lost and decided to switch to an IIFE workflow instead. This made more sense to me logically, but with this change, I had to refactor everything into the IIFE format.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about DOM manipulation with this project and how I've got to be careful with event listeners and loops that contain event listenrs and other dynamic elements. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why a button wasn't working or doing what I expected it to do.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed learning about local storage with this project! I definitely need more practice but it was really cool to see my app work with new data input, data changes, and reloading that data.</p>
<p>I waited to bundle with webpack until I had a mostly working application. I would probably do this at the start of my next project...</p>
<p>Overall, this was a very challenging project for me, but I learned a great deal from it and look forward to revisiting it soon to make my code more concise, efficient, and add some more features.</p>

<h2>Additional Features I'd Like to Add Eventually:</h2>
<ul>Front page that loads all tasks in all projects</ul>
<ul>Ability to change project from the edit task modal</ul>
<ul>Ability to sort tasks by due-date/name/priority</ul>
<ul>View of tasks that are due today/this week</ul>
<ul></ul>
